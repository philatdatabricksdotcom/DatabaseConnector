DatabaseConnector is part of [HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/).

Introduction
============
This R package provides function for connecting to various DBMSs. Together with the `SqlRender` package, the main goal of `DatabaseConnector` is to provide a uniform interface across database platforms: the same code should run and produce equivalent results, regardless of the database back end.

Features
========
- Create connections to the various database platforms:
  - MicrosoftSQL Server
  - Oracle
  - PostgresSql
  - Microsoft Parallel Data Warehouse (a.k.a. Analytics Platform System)
  - Amazon Redshift
  - Apache Impala
  - Google BigQuery
  - IBM Netezza
  - SQLite
  - Spark
- Statements for executing queries with 
  - Error reporting to file
  - Progress reporting
  - Multiple statements per query
- Support for fetching data to Andromeda objects
- Insert data frame to a database table
- Supports the DBI interface
- Integrates with RStudio's Connections tab

Examples
========
```r
connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms="postgresql", 
                                             server="localhost",
                                             user="root",
                                             password="blah",
                                             schema="cdm_v4")
conn <- connect(connectionDetails)
querySql(conn,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM person")
disconnect(conn)
```

Technology
============
DatabaseConnector is an R package using Java's JDBC drivers. 

System Requirements
===================
Running the package requires R with the package rJava installed. Also requires Java 1.8 or higher.

Installation
============

1. See the instructions [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html) for configuring your R environment, including Java.

2. To install the latest stable version, install from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("DatabaseConnector")
```


To download and use the JDBC drivers for Oracle, SQL Server, PDW, PostgreSQL, or RedShift, you can use the `downloadJdbcDrivers()` function. For BigQuery, Impala, or Netezza, see [these instructions](http://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/reference/jdbcDrivers.html).

To be able to use Windows authentication for SQL Server, you have to install the JDBC driver. Download the .zip from [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/download-microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15) and extract its contents to a folder. In the extracted folder you will find the file sqljdbc_9.2/enu/auth/x64/mssql-jdbc_auth-9.2.0.x64.dll (64-bits) or ssqljdbc_9.2/enu/auth/x86/mssql-jdbc_auth-9.2.0.x86.dll (32-bits), which needs to be moved to location on the system path, for example to c:/windows/system32. If you not have write access to any folder in the system path, you can also specify the path to the folder containing the dll by setting the environmental variable `PATH_TO_AUTH_DLL`, so for example `Sys.setenv("PATH_TO_AUTH_DLL" = "c:/temp")`.
